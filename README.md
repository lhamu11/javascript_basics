# javascript_basics


In this file, I have used javascript operators to execute different tasks through variables. 
Following are the list of tasks accomplished:

Create a variable add and assign it the sum of a and b.
Create a variable sub and assign it result of b subtracted from a.
Create a variable mul and assign it the product of a and b.
Create a variable div and assign it the result of of a divided by b.
Create a variable inc and assign it the preincremented value of a.
Create a variable dec and assign it the predecremented value of b.
Assign the string "Learning Javascript with AlmaBetter" to variable test and perform following
  Console log the length of string
  Extract "AlmaBetter" from string using slice() and console log it
  Replace "Javascript" with "Web3.0" in test and console log it
  Convert test to upper case using built in function and console log it
  Concat "Web3.0 is future" to test and console log it

Thank you.
